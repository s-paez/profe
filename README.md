# PROFE: Pipeline de Reducción de OPTICAM para Fotometría de Exoplanetas
#### Reduction pipeline for OPTICAM photometry of exoplanets.

A Python-based pipeline to automate preprocessing and postprocessing of data acquired with the OPTICAM instrument on the 2.1 m telescope at OAN‑SPM, aimed at producing calibrated light curves and centroid analyses for transiting exoplanets implementing the data reduction methods proposed by Paez et. al (in prep.).

---

## Features

* **Preprocessing** (`profe_pre`):

  * Organize and standardize FITS files.
  * Update headers and compute Julian Dates.
  * Apply median filter
* **Postprocessing** (`profe_out`):

  * Altitude-Azimuth trajectory and centroids and movement in pixels .
  * Generate binned light curves with RMS measurements.
  * Time-averaging curves to see the red noise in the time-series.
  * Radial profile
  * Field of View with apertures for targat and comparison stars

---

## Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.8.20
* Dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`:

  * `numpy`$\geq$ 1.24.4
  * `pandas`$\geq$ 2.0.3
  * `astropy`$\geq$ 5.2.2
  * `matplotlib`$\geq$ 3.7.5
  * `tqdm`$\geq$ 4.67.1
  * `mc3`$\geq$ 3.1.5

## Installation

Install from the project root:

```bash
pip install profe
```

For a development environment (include testing and linting tools):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-paez/profe.git
cd profe
pip install .[dev]
```

---

## Usage

### Preprocessing

Organize raw data from `data/` directory into the `organized_data/` directory, update time headers, perform median filter correction:

```bash
profe_pre
```

### Outputs

Generate light curves (plots and files), centroid movement plots, Alt-Az trajectory, Field of View apertures, radial profile and time-averaging curves for `measurements.tbl` files:

```bash
profe_out
```
